# AI Project: Smart Traffic Violation Pattern Detector

## Overview
This is a Streamlit-based dashboard application for analyzing traffic violation patterns. It provides insights into violations, fines, license data, and various risk indicators using data visualization.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository** (if you haven't already):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd AI-project
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
   It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment**:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Application

To start the dashboard, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The application should automatically open in your default web browser. If not, open the URL displayed in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:8501`).
